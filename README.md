### üíº Business Use Case

> **This project showcases how advanced data querying and analytics can be used to uncover critical business insights for Apple retail and product strategy ‚Äî such as identifying underperforming stores, analyzing product and warranty trends, and optimizing sales forecasting ‚Äî all through real-world, enterprise-scale questions.**

## Data Structure & Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The Apple database comprises five tables: `dim_category`, `dim_product`, `fact_sales`, `fact_warranty`,`dim_store`.



![apple_erd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66aff2bf-fda6-4fc9-b73a-b6ca72f34a65)

### Relationship between these tables are as follows:
- `dim_category[category_id]` to `dim_product[category_id]` **(one to one)**
 
- `dim_product[product_id]` to `fact_sales[product_id]` **(one to many)**
 
- `fact_sales[store_id]` to `dim_store[store_id]` **(many to one)**
  
- `fact_sales[sale_id]` to `fact_warranty[sale_id]` **(one to many)**


## üöø Data Cleaning 

### üîß Automated Error Handling in Power Query

**Objective:**  
Automatically replace errors across all columns (including future ones) with a specified value (e.g. `null` or `"ERROR"`), making my query resilient and scalable.

#### üßπ M Code Steps

```m
// STEP 1: Create a dynamic list of {ColumnName, ReplacementValue} pairs
let
    ColumnReplacement = List.Transform(
        Table.ColumnNames(#"Changed Type"),
        each { _, null }  // Replace `null` with any custom error value like "ERROR"
    )
in
    ColumnReplacement

// STEP 2: Apply dynamic error replacement across all columns
= Table.ReplaceErrorValues(
    #"Changed Type",
    ColumnReplacement
)
```
