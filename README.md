  <i>A business-driven analytical deep dive into Appleâ€™s store performance, product sales trends, and warranty behavior.</i>

### ðŸ’¼ Business Use Case

> **This project showcases how advanced data querying and analytics can be used to uncover critical business insights for Apple retail and product strategy â€” such as identifying underperforming stores, analyzing product and warranty trends, and optimizing sales forecasting â€” all through real-world, enterprise-scale questions.**

## Data Structure & Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The Apple database comprises five tables: `dim_category`, `dim_product`, `fact_sales`, `fact_warranty`,`dim_store`.



![apple_erd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66aff2bf-fda6-4fc9-b73a-b6ca72f34a65)

### Relationship between these tables are as follows:
- `dim_category[category_id]` to `dim_product[category_id]` **(one to one)**
 
- `dim_product[product_id]` to `fact_sales[product_id]` **(one to many)**
 
- `fact_sales[store_id]` to `dim_store[store_id]` **(many to one)**
  
- `fact_sales[sale_id]` to `fact_warranty[sale_id]` **(one to many)**


## ðŸš¿ Data Cleaning 

### ðŸ”§ Automated Error Handling in Power Query

**Objective:**  
Automatically replace errors across all columns (including future ones) with a specified value (e.g. `null` or `"ERROR"`), making my query resilient and scalable.

#### ðŸ§¹ M Code Steps

```m
// STEP 1: Create a dynamic list of {ColumnName, ReplacementValue} pairs
let
    ColumnReplacement = List.Transform(
        Table.ColumnNames(#"Changed Type"),
        each { _, null }  // Replace `null` with any custom error value like "ERROR"
    )
in
    ColumnReplacement

// STEP 2: Apply dynamic error replacement across all columns
= Table.ReplaceErrorValues(
    #"Changed Type",
    ColumnReplacement
)
```
